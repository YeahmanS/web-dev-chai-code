No, in JavaScript, we do **not** directly hold a reference to the `setTimeout` function itself, but we can **hold a reference** to the **timeout ID** returned by `setTimeout`.

### Explanation:
When you call `setTimeout`, it returns an ID (a numeric value or an object, depending on the environment). This ID is used to reference the scheduled timeout and can be used to cancel the timeout using `clearTimeout`.

For example:

```javascript
const timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This will run after 1 second");
}, 1000);

// You can cancel the timeout before it runs
clearTimeout(timeoutID);
```

Here, `timeoutID` is the reference to the timeout, and by using `clearTimeout(timeoutID)`, you can prevent the scheduled function from executing.

### In your code:
The `setTimeout` inside `wait` and `doo_guna_wait` is used to delay the resolution or rejection of the promise. However, you're not directly storing or interacting with the `setTimeout` function; you're just letting it do its job and handle the asynchronous behavior.

In summary:
- You **do not hold a reference** to the `setTimeout` function itself, but you can hold a reference to the **timeout ID** it returns, which allows you to control (e.g., cancel) the timeout.
